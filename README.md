Background:
A Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is an NP-complete problem. A salesman 
is given a list of cities and a cost to travel between each pair of cities (or a list of 
city locations). The salesman must select a starting city and visit each city exactly 
one time and return to the starting city. His problem is to find the route (also 
known as a Hamiltonian Cycle) that will have the lowest cost.
