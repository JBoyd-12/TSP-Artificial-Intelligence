# Closest Edge Insertion Heuristic
- Solve an instance of a TSP problem by using a variant of the greedy heuristic
- Build tour by starting with one vertex, and inserting vertices one by one.
- Always insert vertex that is closest to an edge already in tour.
- Data for each problem will be supplied in a .tsp file (a plain text file).
