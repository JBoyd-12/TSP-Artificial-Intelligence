# Search with BFS and DFS
For the given dataset (11PointDFSBFS.tsp), starting at the first city (city 1) find the shortest path to the goal city (city 11). 
*Implement Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithms
Visit cities in numerical order if you need to break a tie. You can hardcode connected edges into your algorithm for this problem, see table below
